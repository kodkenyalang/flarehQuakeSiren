# Contributing to QuakeSiren

We love your input! We want to make contributing to QuakeSiren as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Pull Requests

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
2. Update the documentation with details of any changes to functionality.
3. The PR should work for Node.js 18+.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.

## Code Style

Please follow the coding style and organization already established in the project. This includes:

1. Using TypeScript for all JavaScript code
2. Following the established component structure for React components
3. Using shadcn/ui components where appropriate
4. Writing comments for complex functionality
5. Using meaningful variable and function names

## Smart Contract Development

When contributing to the smart contracts:

1. Always include comprehensive test coverage for contract functionality
2. Document functions with NatSpec comments
3. Follow the Solidity style guide
4. Optimize for gas efficiency where possible
5. Run security checks before submitting

## Testing

We use Jest for testing our components and logic. Please write tests for new code you create.

## Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue with the bug template.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or things you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We also use GitHub issues to track feature requests. If you have an idea for a feature, please:

1. Check if the feature has already been suggested
2. Use the feature request template to create a new issue
3. Be as detailed as possible about why the feature would be useful
4. Describe the use cases for the feature
